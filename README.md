# SwiftyLaunchRules

The **SwiftyLaunchRules** repository is a collection of markdown files designed to be useful when working with [SwiftyLaunch](http://swiftylaun.ch) and developing with LLMs or AI-powered coding tools like Cursor. It provides a structured set of rules and guidelines currently supporting v1.5.

At the core of this repository is swiftrules.md, which serves as a high-level introduction to SwiftyLaunch. It provides an overview of the project’s structure, guiding principles, and details about the App Module, which is included in all projects.

Beyond this introduction, the repository includes discrete markdown files for each module, allowing AI-assisted development tools to efficiently retrieve relevant information. These files cover essential topics such as integration, error handling, environment-specific code, analytics, deep linking, and more, making them a helpful resource for AI-powered coding assistants.

**Note:** These rules were inspired by [SwiftRules](https://github.com/danielraffel/SwiftRules), which, in turn, was heavily inspired by [Swift Cursor Rules](https://www.rayfernando.ai/swift-cursor-rules) and includes some of its text verbatim.

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

These rules assume you are using the following extensions in Cursor, VSCode, or similar editors:

- **[Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev)** – Enables command-line iOS app builds with Xcode.
- **[InjectionIII](https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII)** – Supports hot reloading for SwiftUI views.

These best practices ensure your code remains clean, scalable, and maintainable by utilizing the latest SwiftUI features and adhering to the [VIPER architecture](https://medium.com/@pinarkocak/understanding-viper-pattern-619fa9a0b1f1).

For a walkthrough on setting up Sweetpad and InjectionIII, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7BVmsZSmWQ).

## What is SwiftyLaunch?

SwiftyLaunch is an iOS app generator designed to streamline the development process by creating a new Xcode project with foundational code pre-written. By taking care of repetitive setup work, SwiftyLaunch allows developers to focus on what makes their app unique.
